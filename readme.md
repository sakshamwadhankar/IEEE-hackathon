# Virtual Pet - IEEE Hackathon

A simple Virtual Pet game

## Project Description

This is a simple and interactive virtual pet game created for the IEEE Hackathon. The game is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with 3D scenes powered by Spline.

## üéÆ How to Play

The goal is to keep your virtual pet happy and well-fed!

- **Name Your Pet**: When the game starts, you'll be prompted to give your pet a name.
- **Monitor Stats**: Keep an eye on the Happiness and Hunger bars in the bottom-left corner. They will slowly decrease over time.
- **Travel to Different Scenes**: Click the map icon in the top-right corner to open the travel menu.
  - Feeling Sad? Go to the Drive scene to increase your pet's happiness.
  - Feeling Hungry? Visit the Island scene to fill up your pet's hunger bar.
  - Home: The main area where your pet hangs out.
- **Game Over**: If either the Happiness or Hunger bar reaches zero, the game will end. You can restart to try again!
